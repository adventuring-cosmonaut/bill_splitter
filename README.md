The site is a bill splitter for dining out with several people, including tips. <br> <br> It will:

- Take total bill amount
- Number of people to split between
- Tip %, including an option for a custom tip %
- Split the bill amongst the amount of people showing amount to pay per person, outputting:
  - Tip amount per person
  - Total to pay per person
- Reset button to reset bill amount and custom tip field when clicked

The UI was simply to be recreated based on design images provided. <br> <br>

JS for functionality was written from scratch without guidelines to go by.
